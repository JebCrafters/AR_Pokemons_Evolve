# AR_Pokemons_Evolve
As part of a university project, we created an augmented 
reality application based on the Unity3D game engine and 
the Vuforia plugin. 
The main task of this application is to scan pok√©mon cards and display 
their models in augmented reality. Just implemented the possibility of pokemon 
evolution with a combination of several cards.

Additional functionality is a pokemon database in which you can without scanning look at all of the existing (in the database of the application pokemons as well as their 3d models).
