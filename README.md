# AR_Pokemons_Evolve
As part of a university project, we created an augmented 
reality application based on the Unity3D game engine and 
the Vuforia plugin. 
The main task of this application is to scan pok√©mon cards and display 
their models in augmented reality. Just implemented the possibility of pokemon 
evolution with a combination of several cards.  Used software and languages: Unity3D, C#.
